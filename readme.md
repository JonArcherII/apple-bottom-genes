# `apple-bottom-jeans`
`apple-bottom-jeams` is an open-source genetic traits and disease screening tool based on public genetic information. The idea is that you'd order a consumer genetic kit from a company like 23andMe® or AncestryDNA® (neither are affiliated), export your DNA, and be able to run it through this program to further determine information about your DNA.

More is coming soon...

## Notes
The results that come from this software are in no way an actual medical diagnosis. If you want to be properly diagnosed/screened, please consult your doctor.

Both myself and this software are in no way responsible for the results of this program, including your response, loss of data, or anything else.

All resources brought in from external sources are documented and cited (see the `readme.md` in the `markers/` directory).

This software is released under the MIT license.
