# Markers
This directory holds `json` files which define the genomic markers to compare against a given 23andMe® (not affiliated), AncestryDNA® (also not affiliated), or compatible DNA text file. They are organized by disease/trait, and sources are listed alongside each marker spec, in Chicago style. Further, a complete list is maintained here.
